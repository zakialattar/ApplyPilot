## What It Does

ApplyPilot is a 6-stage autonomous job application pipeline. It discovers jobs across 5+ boards, scores them against your resume with AI, tailors your resume per job, writes cover letters, and **submits applications for you**. It navigates forms, uploads documents, answers screening questions, all hands-free.

Three commands. That's it.

```bash
pip install applypilot
pip install --no-deps python-jobspy && pip install pydantic tls-client requests markdownify regex
applypilot init          # one-time setup: resume, profile, preferences, API keys
applypilot doctor        # verify your setup — shows what's installed and what's missing
applypilot run           # discover > enrich > score > tailor > cover letters
applypilot run -w 4      # same but parallel (4 threads for discovery/enrichment)
applypilot apply         # autonomous browser-driven submission
applypilot apply -w 3    # parallel apply (3 Chrome instances)
applypilot apply --dry-run  # fill forms without submitting
```

> **Why two install commands?** `python-jobspy` pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver, but works fine at runtime with any modern numpy. The `--no-deps` flag bypasses the resolver; the second command installs jobspy's actual runtime dependencies. Everything except `python-jobspy` installs normally.

## Two Paths

### Full Pipeline (recommended)
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Node.js (for npx), Gemini API key (free), Codex CLI, Chrome

Runs all 6 stages, from job discovery to autonomous application submission. This is the full power of ApplyPilot.

### Discovery + Tailoring Only
**Requires:** Python 3.11+, Gemini API key (free)

Runs stages 1-5: discovers jobs, scores them, tailors your resume, generates cover letters. You submit applications manually with the AI-prepared materials.

---

## The Pipeline

| Stage | What Happens |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Discover** | Scrapes 5 job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs) + 48 Workday employer portals + 30 direct career sites |
| **2. Enrich** | Fetches full job descriptions via JSON-LD, CSS selectors, or AI-powered extraction |
| **3. Score** | AI rates every job 1-10 based on your resume and preferences. Only high-fit jobs proceed |
| **4. Tailor** | AI rewrites your resume per job: reorganizes, emphasizes relevant experience, adds keywords. Never fabricates |
| **5. Cover Letter** | AI generates a targeted cover letter per job |
| **6. Auto-Apply** | Codex navigates application forms, fills fields, uploads documents, answers questions, and submits |

Each stage is independent. Run them all or pick what you need.

## ApplyPilot vs The Alternatives

| Feature | ApplyPilot | AIHawk | Manual |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| Job discovery | 5 boards + Workday + direct sites | LinkedIn only | One board at a time |
| AI scoring | 1-10 fit score per job | Basic filtering | Your gut feeling |
| Resume tailoring | Per-job AI rewrite | Template-based | Hours per application |
| Auto-apply | Full form navigation + submission | LinkedIn Easy Apply only | Click, type, repeat |
| Supported sites | Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs, 46 Workday portals, 28 direct sites | LinkedIn | Whatever you open |
| License | AGPL-3.0 | MIT | N/A |

## Requirements

| Component | Required For | Details |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Python 3.11+ | Everything | Core runtime |
| Node.js 18+ | Auto-apply | Needed for `npx` to run Playwright MCP server |
| Gemini API key | Scoring, tailoring, cover letters | Free tier (15 RPM / 1M tokens/day) is enough |
| Chrome/Chromium | Auto-apply | Auto-detected on most systems |
| Codex CLI | Auto-apply | Install with `npm install -g @openai/codex`, then run `codex login` |

**Gemini API key is free.** Get one at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com). OpenAI and local models (Ollama/llama.cpp) are also supported.

### Optional

| Component | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| CapSolver API key | Solves CAPTCHAs during auto-apply (hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA, Turnstile, FunCaptcha). Without it, CAPTCHA-blocked applications just fail gracefully |

> **Note:** python-jobspy is installed separately with `--no-deps` because it pins an exact numpy version in its metadata that conflicts with pip's resolver. It works fine with modern numpy at runtime.

---

## Configuration

All generated by `applypilot init`:

### `profile.json`
Your personal data in one structured file: contact info, work authorization, compensation, experience, skills, resume facts (preserved during tailoring), and EEO defaults. Powers scoring, tailoring, and form auto-fill.

### `searches.yaml`
Job search queries, target titles, locations, boards. Run multiple searches with different parameters.

### `.env`
API keys and runtime config: `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `LLM_MODEL`, `CAPSOLVER_API_KEY` (optional).

### Package configs (shipped with ApplyPilot)
- `config/employers.yaml` - Workday employer registry (48 preconfigured)
- `config/sites.yaml` - Direct career sites (30+), blocked sites, base URLs, manual ATS domains
- `config/searches.example.yaml` - Example search configuration

---

## How Stages Work

### Discover
Queries Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, ZipRecruiter, Google Jobs via JobSpy. Scrapes 48 Workday employer portals (configurable in `employers.yaml`). Hits 30 direct career sites with custom extractors. Deduplicates by URL.

### Enrich
Visits each job URL and extracts the full description. 3-tier cascade: JSON-LD structured data, then CSS selector patterns, then AI-powered extraction for unknown layouts.

### Score
AI scores every job 1-10 against your profile. 9-10 = strong match, 7-8 = good, 5-6 = moderate, 1-4 = skip. Only jobs above your threshold proceed to tailoring.

### Tailor
Generates a custom resume per job: reorders experience, emphasizes relevant skills, incorporates keywords from the job description. Your `resume_facts` (companies, projects, metrics) are preserved exactly. The AI reorganizes but never fabricates.

### Cover Letter
Writes a targeted cover letter per job referencing the specific company, role, and how your experience maps to their requirements.

### Auto-Apply
Codex launches a Chrome instance, navigates to each application page, detects the form type, fills personal information and work history, uploads the tailored resume and cover letter, answers screening questions with AI, and submits. A live dashboard shows progress in real-time.

The Playwright MCP server is configured automatically at runtime per worker. No manual MCP setup needed.

```bash
# Utility modes (no Chrome/Codex needed)
applypilot apply --mark-applied URL    # manually mark a job as applied
applypilot apply --mark-failed URL     # manually mark a job as failed
applypilot apply --reset-failed        # reset all failed jobs for retry
applypilot apply --gen --url URL       # generate prompt file for manual debugging
```

For `applypilot apply --gen --url ...`, run the generated prompt with:

```bash
applypilot-codex-runner --model gpt-5.4 --worker-id 0 --cdp-port 9222 --prompt-file /path/to/prompt.txt
```
